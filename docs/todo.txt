# This file is a random list of things that we can add to InfoMan.
# todo-scheduled.txt is the file that contains the current schedule.

## a simple windows gui program that pings the server from time to time (e.g. 
every 5 min) and sends an e-mail if the server is down.

## need to improve logging in yp_retrieve.py. We just got an e-mail with just "failed to parse 
data" which doesn't even show where the problem was. Only yp_retrieve.py has 
such logging.
note: hmmm... yp_retrieve.py have individual logging of parsing failures for 411.com and yp.com, 
but it sends also (i think) email when log(SEV_EXC, "failed to parse data\n") is called (when 2 of 2 fails)
so this is not bug. (you will recive 3 mails: 1-yp.com fails, 2-411.com fails, 3-"failed to parse data")

## stats: version used stats, especially to see how many current requests are 
done with outdated version (to see how quickly people update InfoMan)

## add request popularity stats to stats script.

## move all http calls to getHttp

## amazon: improve the way we show comments. Details TBD

## netflix: improve the way we show information. Details TBD

## amazon: add ability to buy directly from InfoMan

## jokes: make it work even if the server is down/changed the format.
 - cache all jokes locally in a file when we download them, so that we can
   get them from this file when the server is down/parsing fails
 - find another, backup source of data

## possibly very hard: add barcode recognition via treo camera and ability to 
lookup things in amazon from scanned barcode.

## fix failing unit tests
6 out of 41 tests failed
Failing tests: 3 9 30 70 71 72

## images support for iPedia

## fix table list of modules
- when we switch to table list, the selection is not visible until we scroll
- when scrolling up or down, selection gets lost
- test table selection when there is odd number of items i.e. number of rows in
  both columns isn't equal. Not sure if scrolling of selection works for that
  case.

## add "update all" function. Many people seem to be asing for it.

## some list items don't have margins on the left & right. Since we stretch the lists
to fill entire screen's width it looks ugly. Some examples:
- Jokes
- Amazon
- Netflix
- Recipes
- LOB
- Horrorscopes

## Hyperlink movie titles from "box office" module to the movies module
Would probably have to change the display to wiki based.

## add more movie information to movie times module
We should display the director, cast, running time, rating etc.
Size: medium

## add movie reviews to movie times
We should add links to movie reviews. That requires spidering of movie reviews
from other sites.
Size: big

## Reduce the size of *prc by at least 100 kB.

Don't know exactly how, but our executable is way too big (currently around
600kB) compared to what we do. I suspect that using all this C++ causes this
bloat. Usually I wouldn't care (programmer efficiency is more important than
size of the resulting executable) but in this case we ask people to download
*prc over-the-air so we do need to make them as small as possible.

The ways to reduce code size that I see:
* use String as little as possible, use char_t * instead. I've seen reductions
of 200 bytes just by changing type of one variable from String to char_t. 200
bytes seem small, but I believe those things add up. One thing that we should
change is the list item renderers
* reduce number of getters/setters
* not using classes and OO when not necessary

This will probably be an on-going thing.

## Server load and performance testing
1. Stress testing i.e. bombarding the server with random, parallel request. Can
be done from python using threads. Parameters: how many multiple requests
(threads) to use at once, how many requests to launch.
2. Performance testing. For each module/type of the request we need to know how
many requests per unit of time our server can handle. We need a framework for
easy adding tests for new modules, launching the tests, remembering and
comparing results (so that we can track how numbers change)

## T5 5-way compatibility. T5 also supports 5-way nav and focus rings like treo
but has different api. We should support it as well (according to docs palmOne
will release a glue library in sdk that'll support both treo api and t5 api but
that didn't happen yet).

## selection problem - what kind of selection we want to use?
1) as it is now (like CW selection):
    - when selecting left, pice of letter makes selection
    - when selecting right, pice of letter makes selection of previous one
2) select by pice
    - any direction, if only pice of letter is under selection range, select this letter
3) select by middle
    - any direction, if center of letter is under selection range, seletc this letter
IMHO 3) is the best (MSWord :)). (2 - how to select nothing?)(1 - asymmetric)

## box office: somehow link movies to their information in the "movie times"
module (only after movies location is selected)

## box office: add (default?) single line display without gross info so that all
movies fit in one screen. Add ability to switch between those 2 views.

## movie times: add info about movies (short description, cast, director,
rating, running time etc.). This is available on the website.

## stocks: show the quantity of currently selected stock on the list in the
upper right part of the screen, after the form title.

## stocks: ability to display all portfolios on one screen (on one list, one
after another). Alternatively we have a virtual 'combined' portfolio that has
all stocks from all portfolios on one screen.
Pri: low

## stocks: entering a fractional number of shares in a portfolio should be
allowed (or at least we should display an error if user gives that). Currently
we silently truncate to 0.

## optional keyboard launching of modules from the main screen.
What's left to do:
1. preferences item to turn it on/off (call it "disable keyboard launch" ?)

## Color schemes

Implement color schemes schemes i.e. user ability to define what
colors are used to display list elements etc. We should have a few pre-defined
schemes and ability to create user-defined schemes.

Pri: low

## simplify LookupManagerBase/LookupProgressReporter
My head hurts just by looking at this. Why is it any more complicated than
LookupManagerBase having a pointer to ProgressReporter which has 1
method reportProgress(int percentage) ??? Everything else is managed in
ProgressReporter (size, look of the report). In truth, just a callback
function would do, packaging it as a class is just a convenience.

## Add phone information to module "movies"
We can get phone number for a given theater by retrieving an additional
page e.g.:
http://movies.yahoo.com/showtimes/showtimes.html?z=san+jose+ca&r=sim
and click "Theater info":
http://movies.yahoo.com/showtimes/theater?id=459&date=20040902
We should retrieve that number, send it to the client, show it as a link
on when users clicks that link, we start a call.
The problem is that it requires getting a new html page for each theater which
takes more time, so I'm not sure if it's worth it.
If we do it after v1, this might also cause compatibility problems with older
clients.
(in udf we have item: (name, address).
so if we assert greater instead of equal older clients just wont see it
we can then send (name, address, phone) tuple)

## Ability to create list of theaters in module movies
Handmark Express has a nice feature: a user can create a list of theaters so
that when he updates data, it updates data for a list of theaters he created
and not just theaters for a given zip code

## Add list of recent items for dialogs that ask for input.

E.g. in a dialog that ask for a location (zip code or city/state), we should
also have a list with N (say 10) previous locations entered by a user, sorted
by time they were last used.

This will especially help when user wants to e.g. check a weather in a
different city but then quickly switch to his main city. Having a list of N
recent location he won't have to re-enter his default location after changing
it temporarily.

This general idea applies to many dialogs. They should be changed to forms with
entry fields for data at the top and a list of recent entries below.

We would store this info in preferences.

## Address book & Memo pad - category

New records inserted by our functions have category "Unfiled". Decide if we should
implement methods to create and then insert data in that category (for example
results from 411 will be stored in "ArsLexis - 411" category instead of "Unfiled"

## timing http calls (and more)
It could be useful to know how much time all http calls take when we retrieve
data from the internet. That way we could look at stats and e.g. try to find
other sources of data for slow queries. We could also add more extensive timing
tracing so that we can tell how much time a given portion of the request
handling takes.

## add unit conversion functionality
Something similar to http://www.ridic.com/products/apples/index.html
This doesn't require server component, the whole logic is in the client. The
idea is that our product is a good "traveler companion" (because we have
weather, movie times, currency conversion, international calling codes) so this
would improve InfoMan's capabilities as traveler companion.
