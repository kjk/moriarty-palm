This file lists ideas for future possible modules. It only has a short info, more
detailed information is in module_*.txt files.

Modules marked as risky are those that I think can get us in legal trouble
(i.e. the copyright owner of the data might sue us for copyright infringment).

@ Sports

Getting latest sport scores for footbal, baseball, basketball, hockey. Express
has it, Watson has it and it looks like it would be popular module.

It could be done either as sub-modules of Sport module (like in Phone Book
module) or as independent modules (in which case we could release them one-by-one).

@ quotes of the day
Ultimately we should have all of this data locally at our server and not use
their server. We could spider their site once or try to rebuild the data from
their original sources. But that's for the future.

@ Stocks

We already have it, but it could be improved e.g. adding ability to see stock
charts (graphics of the price change in the last week/month/half a year/year/
3 years etc.).

Make it comparable in functionality with other software of this type:
* http://discuss.treocentral.com/showthread.php?threadid=65316
* 4stocks (http://www.shsh.com/products/)
* StockBroker (http://www.jabesoft.com/)

@ eBooks / eBook downloader

Enables downloading ebooks directly from the device. Has two parts: a spider
that indexes available ebooks, using data from other sites. At very least it
indexes titile, author, url and type (plucker, palm, iSile, eReader etc.).
Then a palm client that allows searching database build by the spider and
manage eBooks on the device (download to the device (storing in memory or on
the card, delete books downloaded by ourselves).
UI on the client would be a google-inspired simple search interface. Ability
to show books in all formats available or only those understood by the device
(and we get that by scanning list of apps for known eBook readers), done
as preferences.

It would be free since it should be very popular and we want at least one very
good free module that'll make people keep InfoMan on their devices.

@ Word of the day

Very simple module: displays "word of the day". There are multiple sources
we could use for this data:
* http://www.wordsmith.org/words/today.html
* http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/ (http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/)
* http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/mwwod.pl
* http://www.oed.com/cgi/display/wotd
* http://www.nytimes.com/learning/students/wordofday/ (uses Merriam-Webster
m-w.com data, but not sure if shows the same thing as m-w.com at the same day)
* http://home.mn.rr.com/wwftd/
* http://www.studyspanish.com/dailyword/
* http://www.onelook.com/?w=dioxin&loc=wotd (a meta-index)
* http://www.transparent.com/wotd/today/ge_wotd.htm
* http://french.about.com/library/motdujour/bl_motdujour.htm
* http://www.infoplease.com/cgi-bin/word
* http://education.yahoo.com/college/wotd/
* http://www.wordthink.com/
* http://travlang.com/wordofday/

It's trivial to cache this data on the server (only changes once a day so we
can re-get it every hour or so). 

Client UI:
a) Multiple levels like in Phone Book module
b) Or just one page that shows them all aggregated. Hyperlinks for headers
so that it's easy to 5-way navigate between words coming from different services.
It's a better solution, I think, since it's faster to use, but might not scale
above some number of services. In this mode users could unselect services
they don't want to see.

As an additional bonus, we could also play the word (some services provide
*.wav file).

@ flight schedule
displays the status of a flight. 
Possible source of data: 
* sniff where does aa timetable pc app gets the data from
  (http://www.aa.com/content/travelInformation/airportAmenities/electronicTimetable.jhtml)
* http://dps1.travelocity.com/dparrqst.ctl?SEQ=110414920080592212272004&LANG=EN

@ weekly most frequently shared songs/movies
There are websites that track which songs/movies are most frequently shared on
p2p networks which is one measure of popularity. We might call it "Popular songs",
"Popular movies" or add to lists of bests. Sources of data:
* http://www.bigchampagne.com/
* http://p2pnet.net/story/3350, http://p2pnet.net/story/3377
  (they use bigchampagne.com data)

@ IMDB.com module

Risky but would be very cool. There's imdb python module.

@ Rottentomatoes.com module

Risky.

@ metacritic.com module

@ eBay module
eBay module would be great since many people use eBay. However, it's not easy
to write. It's hard to decide, which functionality should be included (e.g.
just tracking bids or full searching/displaying information (hard, because
info is arbitrary html).

MODULES UNLIKELY TO BE WRITTEN

@ OED client

Partner with Oxford English Dictionary (http://www.oed.com/) people to provide 
palm client for their on-line dictionary. The module would be free, but people
would have to have existing OED account (which is very expensive, $295/year,
$29.95 a month). It would be very cool and should generate good reviews. However,
I doubt OED would be very interested in working with us, plus they would have to
provide additional interface to their data that we could use (i.e. that's work
for them).

@ Dictionary/Reference

Dictionary lookups using many existing web-based dictionaries.

It would be useful but we probably can't do it. First, we don't want to compete
with iNoah. Second, doing that through our proxy would be pushing things on
the legal side so we would have to go directly to web pages.
