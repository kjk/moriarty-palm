Stocks module.

* General idea: stocks module allows people to view current stock quotes.

* Data source: http://finance.yahoo.com/ (unless can find better)

* Competition, similar programs:
- StockManager (http://www.tinystocks.com/sm.html)
- Handmark Express

* Data model

We have multiple portfolios. Each portfolio is a list of stock symbols (e.g. 
AAPL, MSFT etc.). In first version of the module we'll only have one, default
portfolio, but the code should be written with ability to have multiple 
portfolios in mind.
At first we'll support US stock market.

* UI design

UI in first version will be pretty much the same as in Express:
http://express.handmark.com/ex_stocks.htm i.e. the main screen is an an 
"overview" screen of the portfolio, one stock per line with basic info about 
the stock: last trade, change and change percent.

Selecting an item goes to a detailed screen with an info about one stock. We 
probably won't display every information we send from the server on the detailed 
stock page, only as much as fits on one screen. We can either use a form like 
Express for displaying details or use a list. At the bottom we have "Done" and 
"Update" buttons

The only differences:
- instead of "New" button we have "Add" and it'll be to the right of the screen, 
not next to "Update" button
- we don't have the top line which in Express is a scrolling text as in many 
stock tickers on a PC

Pressing "Add" button brings "Add stock" dialog box" whith a field for entering 
a ticker symbol (e.g. AAPL, MSFT etc.) with "Done" and "Cancel" buttons. 

* Client-server protocol

Client sends:
Get-Stocks-Info: $stock1 $stock2 $stock3 ...
e.g.
Get-Stocks-Info: AAPL MSFT

Server returns payload in Stocks-Info which has information about stocks in UDF 
format which will contain:
Last trade, trade time, change, change percent (same as change but in percent), 
previous close, open, bid, ask, day's range, 52wk range, volume, average volume,
market cap, p/e, eps.
