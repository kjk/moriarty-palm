Lyrics module.

Allow to search for songs texts.
Should we allow browsing? (by first letter -> artist ->song list)

Data sources:
http://lyrictracker.com/      (advance search)


Protocol details:

Client requests:
* Get-Lyrics-Search	(query parameters are sended ';' separated [artist, title, album, composer, fulltext]) 
* Get-Lyrics-Item	(id is sended)
Server responses: 
* Lyrics-Search   (each item is: (id, artist, title))
* Lyrics-Item     (text of song)



UI design:

Start from blank page (with help text?)
Buttons:
* Search - popup search form
* Done

Search form looks like: http://lyrictracker.com/main.php?action=advanced
(but maybe without composer, and with one line full text)

After search we show list of results (2 lines: artist, title (or title, artist))
when item is selected we download it and show using stocksDetailedDoneUpdateForm (as amazon, lob, and others)

we should be prepared for adding "browse" option - if added we will not start with empty screen but with a-z0-9 list.
