Current release schedule plan.

Last updated on: 2005-06-20

The basisc idea is to update InfoMan every 2 weeks or so and release a new 
version on Monday (which means that it's built on Sat/Sun). If we can manage to
write modules faster, we'll make a release after a week.

Modules ready for the release:
* recipes
* netflix - important
* ebooks downloader - important
* encyclopedia

Modules that still need work/testing:
* ebay - important but hard to write
* flight schedule
* lyrics
* lists of bests
* iNoah inside InfoMan

Modules that need to be written:
* tv schedules - important
* sport scores/nba - important
* sport scores/nhl - important
* sport scores/footbal - important
* word of the day

Modules that would be nice to have but for one reason or another, might not happen:
* imdb.com
* oed
* rottentomatoes.com
* metacritic.com
* dictionary/reference
