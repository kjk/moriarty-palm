Box office module.

Box office provides information about most popular 
movies during last week

Data sources:
http://movies.yahoo.com/boxoffice/latest/rank.html
http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movies/box_office.php


Protocol details:

Client request: Get-Current-Box-Office. 
Server response: Current-Box-Office with payload
data in our universal data format. Each item is one piece
of information about the movie. We return from the server
as much as we can (depends on the data source we use).

Each item consists of the following elements:
* last week position ("-" means it's a new movie that came out this week)
* movie title
* weekend gross
* cumulative gross
* release weeks
* number of theaters

UI design:

On the client side, we display those as a list. Currently we'll only
display the following:
* position (can be inferred from the item's position)
* title
* weekend gross
* cumulative gross

It'll probably require a 2-line display for each movie. On the bottom
are "Done" button on the left (as in every other module) and "Update"
button on the right (so that it's not close to "Done").
