TV listings module.

** Overview

TV listings module shows tv listings in US. The main challenge is defining good
UI for presenting the data (since there's a lot of data).

Possible source of data:
- tvlistings.zap2it.com, it requires the user to select a zip code and then 
  cable/satellite tv provider
- http://tv.yahoo.com/, requires only zip code (?)

Related: http://membled.com/work/apps/xmltv/, provides data for many tv networks
in xml. Also has a list of similar projects. Using xmltv or xml format might
not be a good idea but it might have some ideas (e.g. which servers to use
to download the data) to use.

** UI design:

To be designed. The basic function is to show tv data for a given day (default
to current day) i.e. which programs are shown at what time on which channel.

Given that there are a lot of channels, we should also provide some functions
to ease browsing of the data e.g.:
- a user can select his favourite shows and we somehow show him those shows
- ability to change the display order of data (e.g. when user prefers some
  tv stations 

See http://www.palmsource.com/interests/movies/#listings for a list of programs
that can be used as an inspiration.

** Protocol

To be designed.

** Future

In the future we might add listings for different countries (xmltv supports a
lot of countries).
