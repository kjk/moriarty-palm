Now I would like you to work on e-book downloader. I wrote some basic info in future-modules.txt

"Enables downloading ebooks directly from the device. Has two parts: a spider that indexes available ebooks, using data from other sites. At very least it indexes titile, author, url and type (plucker, palm, iSile, eReader etc.). Then a palm client that allows searching database build by the spider and manage eBooks on the device (download to the device (storing in memory or on the card, delete books downloaded by ourselves). UI on the client would be a google-inspired simple search interface. Ability to show books in all formats available or only those understood by the device (and we get that by scanning list of apps for known eBook readers), done as preferences.

Links:
* http://www.manybooks.net/ "

The idea is to write a stand-alone spider in python to spider manybooks.net and other sites like this to get book title, author, url of the *.pdb file and maybe other information (genre/category, maybe descritption). We would periodically run it and if there's enough new information, we would update the index on the server.

I don't want to store the data on the server in a database but use lupy
(http://www.divmod.org/Home/Projects/Lupy/) for indexing that.

The interface on the client could be similar to amazon i.e. browsing, searching, link author/title to amazon, encyclopedia.

Then when a user selects a book to download, we download it to either memory or SD card (user has to choose). We keep track of downloaded books, allow the user to see a list of downloaded books so far (we base it on the books we remember were downloaded but only show those that still exist on the device).

------------------

The things that would be nice to have:

1. A cache for *.pdb files that we build on-demand i.e. at the time when a first person downloads a given ebook, we download it and cache it somewhere with mapping to original url. We can then always give this e-book to other people from our server or only when we determine with HEAD request that this url doesn't exist anymore.

In extreme cases we could (slowly and tactfuly) spider all the ebooks so that we'll be operational even if the site that was providing them in the first place is down.

2. Detect most popular eBook readers and allow launching a given book with a given eBook reader directly from list of downloaded ebooks in InfoMan.
