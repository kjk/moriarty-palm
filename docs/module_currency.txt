Rates from this site really come from the cvs below (Central Bank of Canada)

I don't know if that's of any value in US but this is really nice:

This one seems really nice:

This one is based on Malayan Banking - not many currencies, not very useful

* UI

** Main page

Main page is a list of currencies with values. We start with a list
containing 4 most popular currencies (usd, euro, british pound and yen). usd
is set to 1 and the rest to corresponding converted values.

Users can add/delete currencies from this list.

There really is no "from" currency. Currently highlighted currency on the
list is the current "from" currency. We also have "Amount:" text edit field
on the main form. It displays the value of the currently highlighted currency
on the list (the current "from" currency).

We can do that because we have the data for all currencies.

When user edits this value, we dynamically (i.e. while user is still entering
the value) update the values of all other currencies on the list (those are
the current "to" currencies. To see how detect changes to text edit field
while they're made see noah_pro_2nd_segment.c, evtFieldChanged and
DoFieldChanged() in common.c in noah_palm project.

When users enter letters, we should simply ignore them i.e.:
* get text of the field
* strip all characters that are not valid in  a number i.e. only leave 0-9 and "."
* if len(str)>0 - treat the rest as a number and do the conversion

So the layout on the screen would be:
| curr1                       |
| curr2                       |
| ....                        |
| Amount: .....               |
| [Done] [Add] [Del] [Update] |
or:
| Amount: .....     [Update]  |
| [Done]     [Add] [Delete]   |

Pressing [Update] re-downloads latest currency data and updates the
values in the list.

Pressing [Add] brings a list of currencies and allows the user to select one.
If selected, it gets added to the end of the list.

* Selecting currency from list

Pressing [Add] on the main page shows a form where user selects a currency.
There are [OK] and [Cancel] buttons at the bottom. The rest is a list of
currencies. Each entry is one line formatted as follows:
Currency symbol, currency name, countries using this currency e.g.:

BRL, Real, Brazil
EUR, Euro, Austria, Belgium, Finland

First four items on the list are $, euro, british pound and yen. The rest is
a list sorted alphabetically by currency symbol.

When a form is launched, the first item on the list is automatically highlihted.

Pressing a key will automatically scroll list to first currency starting with a
given letter e.g. pressing "u" would scroll to "UAH".

We already do that in "Select state" form, so you can lookup the code for doing
that there.
