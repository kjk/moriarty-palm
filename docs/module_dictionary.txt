Dictionary module.

** Overview

Dictionary module implements a dictionary, similar to what iNoah does, except
better.

It's designed to support multiple dictionaries, although we'll probably only
offer Wordnet 2.0 to the public.

It uses Get-Url request with schema "dict". Then we provide dictionary
identifier (e.g. "wn" for WordNet), space and a search term (usually a
word to find).

The response is a definition.

** Dictionary data

Source data come from wn-dict.txt, wn-word-index.pickle, wn-words.pickle created
from original wordnet 2.0 data by /scripts/wn2infoman.py.
