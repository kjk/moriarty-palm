## finish dictionary module

Dictionary files/structure is already there. What remains to be done:
- server returns a definition for a search when a word is found

- client displays a definition

- a main page is generated by the server and is automatically requested when
  dictionary module is first entered. It's cached on the client and versioned.
  Then we request the version from the server with the first dictionary request
  and re-request the main page when a version changes. The main page says:

"Welcome to english dictionary module. There are $N definition availble.
[Search] for definitions or click on the word to get its definition".

- add ispell support -> when there is no exact match found, we try ispell and 
if ispell returns some matches, we return a page that lists suggestions, 
hyperlinked.

- add lupy support -> create a full-text index on startup, if it doesn't exist 
yest. If there is no direct match, we add a list of words whose definition has
a match.
