 ..  Pitchfork Media's "Everyday is Halloween" It's Halloween, and you know what that means: parents carefully inspecting Oh Henry! bars for razorblades, the best television of the year, and horrible sounds emanating from the neighbors' houses. But is that really enough? Doesn't it suck that kids could be going around with bloody hatchets and fake stab wounds instead of parading as Elmo and firemen? Where's the terror? Where the f*ck is the goddamn fear??<br> <br> That's what we were wondering, until we took a good look at our record collections. Since everything comes back to the beautiful strains of music for us Pitchdorks, we decided we'd share some of the more scarifying sounds we've had the great discomfort of being exposed to. Speakers come alive to these records and bite you. Headphones suck brains. Turntable needles sink under your fingernails. And remember: if the volume's high enough, no one can hear you scream. 3848 Twisted & Bent Bad Boy Butch Batson  3849 Bats on the Dance Floor The Bad Luck 13 Riot Extravaganza  3850 Mask Bauhaus B0000018AL 3851 The Crazy World of Arthur Brown Arthur Brown B000000BEL 3852 Time Machines Coil B00000JZT5 3853 I Know a Girl Who Develops Crime Scene Photos Combatwoundedveteran B00006I4VX 3854 Wrong Side of Memphis Johnny Dowd B00003Q5FW 3855 Curse of the Golden Vampire Alec Empire & Techno Animal B00005BCF3 3856 The Director's Cut Fantomas B00005JA7D 3857 Morton Feldman, Piano and String Quartet Kronos Quartet with Aki Takahashi  3858 1990 Daniel Johnston B000033Z9A 3859 III/Spirale Malax Lard Free  2070 Homotopy to Marie Nurse With Wound B00003WFZY 3860 Les Morts Vont Vite Shub-Niggurath B0000CDUTR 3861 The First Annual Report of Throbbing Gristle Throbbing Gristle B00005K9UK 3862 Heresie Univers Zero B00000AD96 3863 Donc.
