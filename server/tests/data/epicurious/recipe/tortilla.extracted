I mixed a bit of cumin in with the beans corn and onions. I used small cake pans to bake them as it kept all the ingredients more tidy. A Cook from Valencia, CA 03/10/04 4 This was a great appetizer.  So tasty and easy. A Cook from Olympia, WA 01/10/04 4 I've made these 3 times, all to rave reviews.  We prefer green onions instead of the red onion, though.  The red onion overpowers the nice flavor of the extra sharp white cheddar.  They do burn easily - be careful!
