Southern Rice Pilaf Stuffing with Ham, Pecans and Greens At Thanksgiving, rice stuffings are standard on many southern tables. This one, a combination of white rice and wild rice, gets more regional notes from collard greens, pecans and ham.  4 1/2 cups (about) canned low-salt chicken broth<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 3/4 cup wild rice<br> 3/4 cup long-grain white rice<br> <br> <br> 3 tablespoons butter<br> 2 cups chopped ham (about 3/4 pound)<br> 1 1/2 cups chopped onions<br> 1 1/2 cups chopped celery with leaves<br> 1 large bunch collard greens, sliced<br> 2 tablespoons chopped fresh marjoram or 2 teaspoons dried<br> 3 cups packaged cubed bread stuffing<br> 1 cup pecans, toasted, coarsely chopped<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 3 eggs, beaten to blend  Bring 3 cups broth and bay leaf to boil in medium saucepan. Mix in wild rice; reduce heat to low, cover and cook 30 minutes. Mix in white rice. Cover; cook until both are tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes more. Transfer rice to large bowl. Discard bay leaf.<br> <br> Melt butter in heavy large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ham, onions and celery and sauté until onions are tender, about 10 minutes. Add collard greens and marjoram and sauté until greens wilt, about 3 minutes. Add mixture to rice. Mix in cubed stuffing, pecans and nutmeg. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day ahead. Cover and refrigerate.) Mix eggs into stuffing.<br> <br> To bake stuffing in turkey: Fill main turkey cavity with stuffing. Mix enough chicken broth into remaining stuffing to moisten (about 1/2 to 3/4 cup broth, depending on amount of remaining stuffing). Spoon remaining stuffing into buttered baking dish. Cover with buttered aluminum foil. Bake stuffing in dish alongside turkey until heated through, about 30 minutes.<br> <br> To bake all stuffing in pan: Preheat oven to 375°F. Butter 13x9x2-inch baking dish. Mix 1 1/2 cups broth into stuffing. Transfer to prepared dish. Cover with buttered foil and bake until heated through, about 30 minutes. <br> <br> 8 Servings (about 12 cups).<br> Bon Appétit<br> November 1994  100% would make this recipe again A Cook from Albuquerque, NM 11/25/02 3 I ,too, sub'd spinach for collard greens.  I also used basmati rice, because I love how fragrant it is.  It was a good recipe for stuffing and different than our normal-- which uses apricots and dried cherries.  A great change! Definitely one to keep in the rotation. Angela from Ottawa, ON, Canada 12/14/01 4 I brought this issue of Bon Appetit with me to visit a friend in Alabama for American Thanksgiving in 1996.  She and I decided to make this stuffing, but neither of us like collard greens, so we substituted spinach.  I started making this for our Christmas stuffing and it's a hit with my family.  It will be on our table for the 6th straight year this year (2001)!
