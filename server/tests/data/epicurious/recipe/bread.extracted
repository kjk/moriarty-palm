Ciabatta (Italian "Slipper" Bread) The ciabatta does require a simple sponge but it takes only a few minutes to put together the day before making the bread. Though the dough for ciabatta is very wet and sticky, resist the temptation to add more flour. <br> <br> For this recipe you will need a baking stone or unglazed "quarry" tiles. Baking stones are available at cookware shops and by mail order from The Baker's Catalogue, tel. (800) 827-6836. Tiles are also available at the above sources as well as at many tile stores listed in the Yellow Pages.  <b>For sponge</b><br> 1/8 teaspoon active dry yeast<br> 2 tablespoons warm water (105°115° F.)<br> 1/3 cup room-temperature water<br> 1 cup bread flour*<br> <br><b>For bread</b><br> 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast<br> 2 tablespoons warm milk (105°115° F.)<br> 2/3 cup room-temperature water<br> 1 tablespoon olive oil<br> 2 cups bread flour*<br> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt<br> <br> *available at many supermarkets and by mail order from The Baker's Catalogue, tel.

In a bowl stir together yeast mixture, room-temperature water, and flour and stir 4 minutes. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let sponge stand at cool room temperature at least 12 hours and up to 1 day.<br> <br><b>Make bread:</b><br> In a small bowl stir together yeast and milk and let stand 5 minutes, or until creamy. In bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with dough hook blend together milk mixture, sponge, water, oil, and flour at low speed until flour is just moistened and beat dough at medium speed 3 minutes. Add salt and beat 4 minutes more. Scrape dough into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough will be sticky and full of air bubbles.)<br> <br> Have ready a rimless baking sheet and 2 well-floured 12- by 6-inch sheets parchment paper. Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and cut in half. Transfer each half to a parchment sheet and form into an irregular oval about 9 inches long. Dimple loaves with floured fingers and dust tops with flour. Cover loaves with a dampened kitchen towel. Let loaves rise at room temperature until almost doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.<br> <br> At least 45 minutes before baking ciabatta, put a baking stone or 4 to 6 unglazed "quarry" tiles (see note, above) arranged close together on oven rack in lowest position in oven and preheat oven to 425° F.<br> <br> Transfer 1 loaf on its parchment to baking sheet with a long side of loaf parallel to far edge of baking sheet. Line up far edge of baking sheet with far edge of stone or tiles, and tilt baking sheet to slide loaf with parchment onto back half of stone or tiles. Transfer remaining loaf to front half of stone or tiles in a similar manner. Bake ciabatta loaves 20 minutes, or until pale golden. With a large spatula transfer loaves to a rack to cool. <br> <br> Makes 2 loaves.<br> Gourmet<br> March 1998  100% would make this recipe again A Cook from Seattle 04/20/04 4 Wow - this is the best bread I have ever made.  I fudged a little on the rise time because I was in a hurry by putting the bread on top of a warm stove and it still turned out great.  I too used King Arthur's bread flour - very tasty.  I think I will try to work in some whole-wheat flour into the bread dough (not the sponge) next time to add fiber and make it a bit more healthy. deb from chicago 02/04/04 0 This "sponge" was like nothing I've ever worked with, however, the ciabatta turned out great (thanks to a little coaching from Dee from NY)!  I am now starting a sourdough starter . . . Boo Hoo Atkins-alholics! Kate H from Lake Havasu City, AZ 10/25/03 3 Very good.  I used bread flour for the sponge, but substituted 1 cup whole wheat later.  Also, I ran out of parchment so I used waxed paper.  This bread is good with soup, salad or even with homemade jam on top!
