Mom's Chicken Soup with Matzoh Balls, Carrots, and Dill   1 cup matzoh meal<br> 1/4 cup chicken fat<br> 1/2 cup soda water (seltzer)<br> 4 eggs<br> 1 teaspoon salt<br> 4 quarts chicken soup, homemade<br> 3/4 cup orzo (omit during Passover)<br> 2 cups thinly sliced carrots<br> 1/2 cup chopped fresh dill  In a bowl, mix together matzoh meal, chicken fat and seltzer. Whisk eggs in a separate bowl until frothy. Stir into matzoh meal mix with 1 teaspoon salt. Refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours. <br> <br> Bring 2 quarts of chicken soup to a simmer. Take a small spoonful of the mixture and using two small spoons, shape the mixture into small balls (about the size of a large marble) and place in simmering soup. Cook for 35 minutes. <br> <br> Meanwhile, if you're making orzo, toast it in a dry, medium skillet over medium low heat, stirring often until it turns a light golden brown. Boil the orzo until al dente, drain and reserve for soup. <br> <br> Bring remaining 2 quarts of chicken stock to a boil. Cook carrots until al dente. Lower to a simmer, add cooked matzoh balls, orzo (if using), and dill. Serve very hot. <br> <br> Makes 8 servings.<br>"More than a Meal"<br> April 1999<br> Anne Rosenzweig, Executive Chef/Owner<br> The Lobster Club, New York, NY  45% would make this recipe again A Cook from The Bronx, NY 04/02/04 2 Cooking matzoh balls in the makes the soup cloudy. Instead of cooking them in the chicken soup, I substitute chicken soup for the water and that adds the flavor. SkiWhiz from Vermont 04/08/03 2 I also use Seltzer and I too chill for at least 1 hour  (and if the reviewers read the recipe you'd see that it calls for chilling!). But I agree with those who use plain water for cooking.  First of all, that's how my grandmother taught me. Second, my soup is too precious to lose it through the boiling process.  And third, grandma said you do anything to protect the soup against clouding - and that include celery and matzo balls. A Cook from West Hempstead, NY 04/08/03 1 I've been cooking for 35 years, and I am successful cooking matzoh balls in boiling salted water with the pot cover on about 90%.  If you boil or cook water for 35 minutes, it diminishes -- it cooks out.  Why would you want to use precious homemade soup to cook matzoh balls for 35 minutes, and risk loosing a quantity of your soup.  What a waste!  If the matzoh balls are properly seasoned, they will be equally delicous if they are cooked in boiling water! Covering the pot while cooking, makes the matzoh balls double or triple in size.
