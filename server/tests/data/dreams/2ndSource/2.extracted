Sex Sex is the most <a>powerful</a> instinct in the human <a>psyche.</a> In dreams, it tends to <a>satisfy</a> a natural desire when sex is <a>absent</a> in waking life. With <a>someone</a> you like platonically: It is an <a>affirmation</a> of a close relationship. With <a>someone</a> you do not like: It is time to <a>moderate</a> those negative feelings about <a>them.</a> With the same sex: It may be <a>yourself</a> trying to deal with your <a>male/</a> female counterpart or the part of you that you do not <a>like.</a>  Sex (intercourse) It is very difficult to name just a few <a>possible</a> interpretations for this <a>dream.</a> It is so complex that <a>interpretations</a> vary with each dreamer and <a>situation</a> in the dream. A <a>sexual</a> dream may be about <a>physical</a> pleasure, but it may also be <a>about</a> power, control, manipulation, <a>virility,</a> and effectiveness. It may be a form of wish <a>fulfillment</a> or a memory, or <a>compensation</a> for a lack in <a>daily</a> life. In most cases, it is not a <a>prediction</a> of things to come in the near <a>future.</a>  Sextuplets A dream about sextuplets <a>suggests</a> that your mental, emotional and <a>spiritual</a> states are coming into <a>harmony.</a> You may also be <a>experiencing</a> positive changes that are <a>making</a> your home life more <a>happy.</a>
