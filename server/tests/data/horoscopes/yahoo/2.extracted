T Weekly Career for November 29, 2004 D November 29, 2004 t The first half of this week, you'll be in touch with the workplace and able to see what needs to happen more clearly than ever. It's a great time to start new projects and improve the efficiency of current work by clearing out dead wood. Try motivation and team-building exercises if you're in a position of leadership. By Thursday you'll experience a burst of energy and feel like an Olympic athlete going for the gold. You'll make great progress by the week's end. Take care of yourself on Saturday and Sunday -- start a new health regimen or just clean up the clutter in your life.
