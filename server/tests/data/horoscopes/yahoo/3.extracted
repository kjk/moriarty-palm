T Monthly Love for December, 2004 D December, 2004 t Sleigh bells ring the 1st -- are you listening? -- because somebody is trying to tell you something, snow bunny. The 2nd and 3rd, those sleigh bells sound a little bit more like ... church bells. Are those 'get-me-there-on-time' bells really ringing for you? Is somebody who's been flirting with you for a while turning suddenly serious? Wow! That sounds good to you. The 11th and 12th, any romance you've been conducting might take on a foreign flavor. You might go out for sushi, or you might go in for a hot, piping, Eastern-European-style mug of cider. Let whatever it is warm you from the inside so that when you go back outside -- where those bells are still ringing! -- you can spend some time listening. The 19th to the 21st, look for something downright ardent to come your way. Is it a holiday wreath decked with a single red, red rose? Some sleigh-riding socks to warm up your toes? A special jingle bell?
